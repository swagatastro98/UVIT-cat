# merged function

There has to be two folders: FUV-cat and NUV-cat, 
There has to be a copy of the FUV-cat folder.

The program searches one by one from the main FUV-cat folder, and searching in the copied FUV-cat folder

The file that is searching will be deleted from the second folder

	If a match is found, then it will copied to the FUV-same folder inside the Same_field folder, 

	If it is not a match, then the files from the second FUV-cat folder will be copied to the test folder.


dataframe_build2():

	A copy of the FUV-same folder will be created

	The same procedure for searching is followed.

	The procedure first deletes the searching file from the second folder so that the same file is not found while searching the list again and doesn't create two files.

	The files are matched, and a single dataframe is created in the combined catalog folder
	A copy of the files found match in the FUV_same_copy folder is transferred to the N folder.

	The catalog_combined folder contains the combined database of the merged files from the FUV_same folder

	This follows the convention of renaming of the column names according to the paper.



merged_sources()

	The files from the merged sources are searched iteratively.
	The coorinates are matched to within 3arcsec, the magntiude columns of the matched coordinates are transferred to a main row
	Output is created in the Merged_folder




dataframe_build3()

	
	Matched NUV files are contained in the NUV_ssame folder, this is matched with the files in the test folder containing the rest FUV files. 

	A merged catalog in the NUV_output folder is created according to file names

	And the matched files of the test folder is transferred to the FUV_folder_after_NUV_match folder (to be excluded)

dataframe_build4()

	The remaining matches from the NUV_same folder is matched with the files in the merged_catalog folder and the informatin of the NUV files are transferred to the FUV files.
